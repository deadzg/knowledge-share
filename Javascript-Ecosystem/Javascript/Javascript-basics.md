# Javascript basics
- Javascript is a scripting/programming language of the web browser.
- On web pages it adds interactivity, from simple animation effects to form validation to full-blown single-page applications.
- JS is both **dynamically typed** (infer variable types at runtime) and **weakly typed**(allow types to be inferred as another type).
- JavaScript is an interpreted language, not a compiled language.
- Javascript is single threaded language.

### Javascript data types
Below six types are considered to be _primitives_. A primitive is not an object and has no methods of its own. All _primitives are immutable_.
- Number
- String
- Boolean
- Null
- Undefined
- Symbol

Everything else is an **Object** type.

### Global objects
**window**

- A global variable, `window`, represents the window in which the script is running, is exposed to JavaScript code.
- Refer https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/obj_window.asp for window object properties and functions. Alternatively, you could type *window* in the console and you can see the same.
- Any variables and functions defined in this scope are global and accessible everywhere.

**document**

- The `document` property points to the DOM document loaded in that window.
- Refer https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_document.asp for the document object properties and functions.
