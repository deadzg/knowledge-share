# Considerations for Software Design
## Phases
- Discovery Phase
- Domain Knowledge
- Technical Architecture
- Security Approval
- Gantt Chart
- Implementation Plan
- Demos

## Pointers
- Best Practices for each tech stack
- Local Environment Setup (Docker)
- Define Types of Environment (Dev, QA, Staging, Production)
- Chat messenger (Skype/Slack)
- Version Control
- Semantic Versioning for Artifact
- Branching Strategy
- Deployment Strategy
- Documentation
- Performance
- Integration Tests
- Unit Tests

## Design Priciples (SOLID)

### SRP : Single Responsibility Principle
- A module should be responsible for one and only one actor ie. it should have on and only one reason to change
- At code level it is about functions and classes
- At component level it becomes `Common Closure Principle (CCP)`
- At architectural level it becomes `Axis of Change` responsible for creation of architectural boundaries


### OCP : Open Closed Principle
### LSP : Liskov Substitution Principle
### ISP : Interface Segregation Principle
### DIP : Dependency Inversion Principle
